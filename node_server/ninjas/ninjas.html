    <h1>Ninja Reunion Sidequest</h1>
    
    <p> Ninja Sidequest  This guide was in great part a collaborative effort between Neversaw and sovest555. The ninja reunion sidequest is initated by the ninja grandmaster Yoshitaka in Tsukinami Village. He can be found in his training dojo by heading east from the Pok√©Center and g the path north. After a short cutscene upon entering the dojo, the grandmaster will hand you a letter and ask you to deliver it to his six disciples, each of which runs an EV-training dojo in Tandor.
